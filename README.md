# IPL2019Analysis
Data Analysis for IPL 2019 tournament

## Getting Started
This project contains basic analysis for IPL 2019 tournament. Currently the project only has analysis for Batsmen and Bowlers, however I do plan to keep adding more as I continue playing more with the data.

## Project Structure
The CSV folder has two files.
<br>
<b>BallsInfo.csv</b> Contains ball by ball data of all the matches conducted in IPL. Data was collected from [Cricsheet](https://cricsheet.org/). In case anyone is interested in getting access to the script I used to convert the YAML files to CSV, feel free contact me. I will gladly share it with you.
<br>
<b>MathcInfo.csv</b> This file contains information about all the matches conducted in the IPL, one thing to keep in mind here is, matches for which result was found using super over were considered as a tie. I do plan to make improvements to this dataset, so stay tuned for that.

## Dependencies
Just like most of the Data Analysis project this one relies on <b>Pandas</b> and <b>Matplotlib</b>.
